## 1. Core UC Statistics Comparison

| Metric | Resolution Foundation | PolicyEngine UK | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Working-age adults in UC | 8.5m (26.0%) | 8.2m (18.8%) | -0.3m (-7.2pp) |
| Children in UC households | 6.5m (54.0%) | 5.2m (41.1%) | -1.3m (-12.9pp) |
| Annual UC expenditure | £86.0bn (2029-30) | £80.3bn (2025) | £-5.7bn |

### PolicyEngine Population Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total working-age population (16-64) | 43.7 million |
| Total children (under 16) | 12.6 million |
| Benefit units receiving UC | 6.39 million |
| Average annual UC award | £12,566 |
| Average monthly UC award | £1,047 |

### Additional RF Comparisons

| Metric | Resolution Foundation | PolicyEngine UK | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Average monthly UC award | £1,030 | £1,047 | £+17 |
| UC families with children | 46.0% | 49.2% | +3.2pp |
| UC childcare recipients | 190k | 1825k | +1635k |
| Avg monthly childcare element | £420 | £356 | £-64 |

## 2. Self-Employment & MIF (Recommendations #1-4)

The Minimum Income Floor (MIF) assumes self-employed UC claimants earn at least
minimum wage × 35 hours/week.

| Metric | PolicyEngine UK |
|--------|-----------------|
| Self-employed working-age adults | 4.88 million |
| Self-employed UC claimants | 0.25 million |
| Carers on UC | 0.53 million |

**RF Recommendations:**
- #1: Extend MIF startup period from 12 to 24 months
- #2: Apply MIF after 3-month rolling average
- #3: Align MIF expected hours with individual work commitments
- #4: Review MIF exemption for carers

## 3. Benefit Cap (Recommendation #8)

The benefit cap limits total household benefits to £22,020/year (£25,323 in London).

| Metric | PolicyEngine UK |
|--------|-----------------|
| Benefit units affected by cap | 233 thousand |
| Total annual reduction from cap | £603 million |
| Average annual loss | £2,584 |
| Average monthly loss | £215 |

**RF Recommendation #8:** Abolish benefit cap for those meeting work requirements.

**Impact of full abolition:** £603m restored to 233k households.

## 4. UC Childcare (Recommendations #9, #11)

UC covers 85% of childcare costs up to £1,014/month (1 child) or £1,739/month (2+ children).

| Metric | PolicyEngine UK |
|--------|-----------------|
| Benefit units receiving UC childcare | 1825 thousand |
| Total UC childcare expenditure | £7.79 billion |
| Average annual childcare element | £4,270 |
| Tax-Free Childcare households | 409 thousand |
| Total TFC value | £0.47 billion |

**RF Recommendations:**
- #9: Extend childcare run-on to 3 months after employment ends
- #11: Better integrate UC childcare with Tax-Free Childcare

## 4b. Marginal Tax Rates (RF Figure 5)

High marginal rates (above 70%) reduce work incentives. RF Figure 5 shows the
share of workers facing very high METRs/PTRs under UC.

| Metric | Resolution Foundation | PolicyEngine UK | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Workers with METR > 70% | 3.0% | 1.1% | -1.9pp |
| Non-workers with PTR > 70% | 9.0% | 0.0% | -9.0pp |

**Note:** METRs measure the effective tax on an extra £1 of earnings for current workers.
PTRs measure the effective tax on moving from out-of-work to in-work. Both are affected
by the UC 55% taper rate plus income tax and National Insurance.

## 5. UC Elements Breakdown

| Element | Annual Expenditure | % of Gross Max |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Total UC (net)** | **£80.3bn** | - |
| **Total UC (gross max)** | **£338.0bn** | **100%** |
| **Taper reduction** | **£257.7bn** | **76%** |
| Standard Allowance | £223.6bn | 66.2% |
| Child Element | £48.4bn | 14.3% |
| Housing Costs Element | £97.3bn | 28.8% |
| Childcare Element | £7.8bn | 2.3% |
| Disability Elements | £27.3bn | 8.1% |
| Carer Element | £2.5bn | 0.7% |

## 6. Explaining the Differences

### Why PE estimates differ from RF:

1. **Entitlement vs Receipt:** PolicyEngine calculates UC **entitlement**, not actual
   claims. Take-up is ~80-85%, so PE overestimates claimant numbers but shows full
   potential reach of UC.

2. **Timing:** RF figures are projections for April 2026 (end of managed migration).
   PE shows 2025 entitlement under current rules.

3. **Data Sources:**
   - RF uses DWP StatXplore administrative data
   - PE uses Family Resources Survey (FRS) microsimulation

4. **Expenditure Year:** RF's £86bn is for 2029-30; PE's £80.3bn is for 2025.

5. **Working Age Definition:** PE uses 16-64; RF may use a different definition
   (e.g., up to State Pension age of 66).
